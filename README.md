# Lpn_demo (Sanitized Demo)

This project is a **sanitized version of a large-scale inventory management tool** originally developed in a professional enterprise environment.

- The focus here is on **architecture**, **logic**, and **form validation** rather than full functionality.
- All references to proprietary systems, databases, assemblies, and internal tooling have been removed or replaced.
- Security-conscious design is maintained, including input validation and code structure.
- Inline comments and documentation links are included to demonstrate design rationale and best practices.

>  Note: This code will not run without backend service stubs, which have been intentionally omitted to preserve IP and security. Mock class definitions or screenshots of working UI may be added to aid understanding.

## Ethics Statement

This code does not contain any proprietary or sensitive information. It was rebuilt from scratch using only generalized concepts and logic flow learned during professional experience. The intent is to showcase skill and problem-solving abilityâ€”not to replicate or expose any company's private systems.
